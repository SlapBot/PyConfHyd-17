# PyConfHyd-17

This repository contains the information my talk over [Stephanie](github.com/slapbot/stephanie-va) held at [PyConf](https://pyconf.hydpy.org/2017/) Hyderabad on 7-8th October

## Introduction

This was my second tech talk in quick succession after the event at [PyData](github.com/slapbot/PyDataDelhi-17) where I spoke about [Stephanie](https://github.com/slapbot/stephanie-va). 

The talk was a small modification of PyData session with more emphasis on NLP Algorithm [Sounder](github.com/slapbot/sounder). There is also a file called `sounder_test.py` to see the sounder library in action.
